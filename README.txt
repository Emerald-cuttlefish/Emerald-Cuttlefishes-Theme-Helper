This is a Project to help peopole create and modify Steam Deck Themes

I am NOT a Programer. I am just a Mechanical Enginnering Student, so I don't really know what I am doing when it comes to programing, github, or CSS.
I am only working on this project in my freetime, and I am a complete amature so don't expect too much.
The Purpose of this project is to map out the steam decks CSS elements and make it easyer to create Steam Deck Themes

- this is my First time making a Git hub reopsitory so I don't know what I am doing.
